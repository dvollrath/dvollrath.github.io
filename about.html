<p>I'm a Professor of Economics at the University of Houston, and (alas) currently also Chair of that department. I've been at UH since 2005, when I received my PhD in Economics from Brown University.</p>

<p>You can find my CV <a href="/assets/cv_current.pdf">here</a></p>

<p>You can reach me at dietz <i> dot </i> vollrath <i>at</i> gmail.com</p>

<p>The header picture is from Quechee, Vermont, where we spend a lot of time over the summer. If you've ever been to Houston from June through like October, you do not need to ask why we go.</p>
