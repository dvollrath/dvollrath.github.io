<p>Abstract: This paper argues that the ‘scale effects’ prediction of many recent R\&amp;D-based models of growth is inconsistent with the time-series evidence from industrialized economies. A modified version of the Romer model that is consistent with this evidence is proposed, but the extended model alters a key implication usually found in endogenous growth theory. Although growth in the extended model is generated endogenously through R\&amp;D, the long-run growth rate depends only on parameters that are usually taken to be exogenous, including the rate of population growth.</p>
