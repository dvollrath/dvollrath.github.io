<p>Abstract:  This paper quantifies the effects of exogenous variations in the state of technology (technological opportunity) and of the R\&amp;D of other firms (spillovers of R\&amp;D) on the productivity of firms’ R\&amp;D. The R\&amp;D productivity is increased by the R\&amp;D of \"technological neighbors,\" though neighbors’ R\&amp;D lowers the profits and market value of low-R\&amp;D-intensity firms. Firms are shown to adjust the technological composition of their R\&amp;D in response to technological opportunity. Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.</p>
