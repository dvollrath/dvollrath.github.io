<p>Abstract: This paper analyzes the role of wealth distribution in macroeconomics through investment in human capital. In the presen ce of credit marketsâ€™ imperfections and indivisibilities in investment in human capital, the initial distribution of wealth affects aggregate output and investment both in the short and in the long run, as ther e are multiple steady states. This paper, therefore, provides an additional explanation for the persistent differences in per-capita output across countries. Furthermore, the paper shows that cross-country differences in macroeconomic adjustment to aggregate shocks can be attributed, among other factors, to differences in wea lth and income distribution across countries.</p>
