<p>Abstract: We model growth and technology transfer in a world where technologies are specific to particular combinations of inputs. Unlike the usual specification, our model does not imply that an improvement in one technique for producing a given good improves all other techniques for producing that good. Technology improvements diffuse slowly across countries, although knowledge spreads instantaneously and there are no technology adoption costs. However, even with \"Ak\" production, our model implies conditional convergence. This model, with appropriate technology and technology diffusion, has more realistic predictions for convergence and growth than either the standard neoclassical model or simple endogenous-growth models.</p>
