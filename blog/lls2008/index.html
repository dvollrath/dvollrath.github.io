<p>Abstract: In the last decade, economists have produced a considerable body of research suggesting that the historical origin of a countryâ€™s laws is highly correlated with a broad range of its legal rules and regulations, as well as with economic outcomes. We summarize this evidence and attempt a unified interpretation. We also address several objections to the empirical claim that legal origins matter. Finally, we assess the implications of this research for economic reform.</p>
