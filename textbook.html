<h3>Summary</h3>
<div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <p>The textbook is a concise introduction to modern growth theory, aimed at advanced undergraduates. The 4th edition is new in 2023, and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~chadj/">Chad Jones</a> (Stanford) is the original author. It covers the basic Solow model, endogenous innovations of both product-variety and quality-ladder types, and then takes on topics in development, the environment, and the take-off to sustained growth. It uses calculus and differential equations, but you can definitely adapt to teach it to students without that background (I do it every year).</p>

              <p>Available from Norton. Find it at <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324059578">this link</a></p>

<h3>Supplements and materials</h3>
<p> I like to think of the <a href="/blog">blog</a> as a supplement to the course, and I use a lot of posts as material when I teach from the book. The publisher's <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/webad.aspx?id=4294969960">site</a> has access to an exam copy or the solutions manual. It also includes PDF's of the books figures.</p>

<p>There is a minimal set of slides based on the book. You can download <a href="https://growthecon.com/assets/JonesVollrathSlides.zip">a zip file of just the PDFs</a>, or you can use <a href="https://github.com/dvollrath/Growth4ed">the Github repository</a>. The Github contains raw TeX for the slides as well as all the code and data that are used to produce figures for the slides and book.</p>

<p>I also maintain a <a href="https://growthecon.com/StudyGuide/">Study Guide</a> site that I use in my own undergraduate class. This covers roughly the same material, and has sub-sections with additional case studies or examples I use in class.</p>

<p>From that Study Guide, the following interactive figures might be useful in any class:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://growthecon.com/StudyGuide/solow/basic-KAL">Finding steady states in the Solow model</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://growthecon.com/StudyGuide/solow/basic-level.html">What determines the BGP?</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://growthecon.com/StudyGuide/solow/basic-solow.html">The relationship of growth rates and levels in the Solow</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://growthecon.com/StudyGuide/ideas/basic-AL.html">Finding steady state productivity growth</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://growthecon.com/StudyGuide/ideas/basic-romer.html">Growth rates and levels of endogenous productivity</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://growthecon.com/StudyGuide/population/basic-malthus.html">Malthusian equilibrium</a></li>
</ul>
These interactive figures are all built using the incredible resources from <a href="https://www.econgraphs.org/">EconGraph</a>
