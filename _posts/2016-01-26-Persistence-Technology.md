CEG provide a nice summary of several lines of reasoning regarding the persistence of technology. 

It is useful to be more careful about describing exactly what we mean by "technological persistence". There is "time-series persistence", which means that your technology level today is a big determinant of your technology level tomorrow. Time-series persistence is why the UK is still technologically advanced, and didn't revert to medieval technologies after the Industrial Revolution. 

"Cross-sectional persistence" is different. This is persistence in the cross-sectional differences in technology. This persistence explains why the lead in technology that the UK had in 1700 still exists today. Cross-sectional persistence is the absence of technological convergence. What CEG are studying is this cross-sectional persistence.

It is probably too detailed, in that they divide up the stories here into 9 categories. It is probably more like 3. Let me try to summarize them here:

1. **Feedback**. Better technology in textiles makes it worth innovating in chemicals to dye those textiles, which leads to scientific advances that spillover into synthetic fabrics and plastics and fertilizers and on and on and on. You can call this "recombinations" or "spillovers" or "complementarities", it doesn't matter. This is just the idea having more technology allows you to find more technology.
2. **Economies of scale**. If better technology makes your economy and market size larger, then this can induce you to actually *adopt* technologies that have high fixed costs. 
3. **Learning by doing**. This is really a statement that technology advances not in the lab, but on the shop floor, so to speak. It is only by actively working with technologies that your improve them and learn from them. So places that have technologies to work with will learn more, and hence advance faster. 

These are all meant as explanations of time-series persistence, but they appear to have implications for cross-sectional persistence as well. Take the whole category of "Feedbacks". If technology has such strong spillovers within a given country, why wouldn't there be spillovers across countries? All the stories involving feedback suggest that there should not be much cross-sectional persistence. If technology makes it easier to find new technology, then it should be easy for other countries to converge towards the technological frontier. 

The second two explanations actually provide a stronger story for the combination of time-series persistence and cross-sectional persistence. With economies of scale, even though you might be able to observe new technologies and how they work, it might not make sense to bother with them. It is why you don't have Wal-marts in town of 300 people in East Texas. 

If you've got good technology, then your market size is large because you are so productive, and hence it makes sense to adopt other technologies that require high fixed costs. This generates time-series persistence, and high technology places stay high-technology. But is *also* generates cross-sectional persistence, because at the other end of the scale, if you never get a large enough market to support the first technologies, you'll never get big enough to adopt the better ones. The differences between high-tech and low-tech places persist.

Learning by doing also is capable of explaining both kinds of persistence. The only way to get high technology is to actually work with high technology, meaning that your technology is time-series persistent. But because of this, cross-sectional differences in tech will persist.
