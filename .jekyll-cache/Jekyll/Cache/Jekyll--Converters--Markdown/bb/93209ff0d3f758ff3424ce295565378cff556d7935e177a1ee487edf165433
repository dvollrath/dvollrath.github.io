I"‹<p>I recently re-read Eric Hobsbawmâ€™s <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2cJTPNr">Industry and Empire</a></em>. I didnâ€™t have a reason, other than that it was shelved near something else I was looking for in the library, and caught my eye. It was definitely before graduate school that I last read it, so it seemed worth revisiting now that Iâ€™ve got my fancy-schmancy education in economics.</p>
