I"Ü<p>There isnâ€™t a real question about there being severe negative impacts of the virus on employment, household finances, or the overall growth rate. What Iâ€™m after here is trying to understand how shocks (and what kind of shocks?) to some industries ripple through the economy to influence others. For example, when you shut down hospitality businesses like restaurants, bars, and hotels, how does that affect suppliers like the food processing or farming industries?</p>
