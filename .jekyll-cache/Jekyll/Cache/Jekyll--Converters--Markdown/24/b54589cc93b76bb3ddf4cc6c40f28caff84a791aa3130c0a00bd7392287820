I"à<p>This coming semester Iâ€™m teaching a new version of my graduate course in growth and development. Iâ€™ve always taught a course that looks at long-run growth, but in the past that has involved at times a lot of theory (e.g. unified growth models) along with a close look at the literature on institutions as the origin of the take-off embedded in that theory. Some of the most popular posts Iâ€™ve every done on this blog were the <a href="https://growthecon.com/blog/the-skeptics-guide-to-institutions-part-1/">â€œSkeptics Guide to Institutionsâ€</a>, which were in part lecture notes for that course. I also folded in material on the transition out of agriculture, something that I find an important part of this transition.</p>
