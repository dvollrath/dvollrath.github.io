I"S<p>In the last <a href="https://growthecon.com/blog/Profit-Accounting/">post</a> I used some findings by <a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~barkai/">Simcha Barkai</a> and the BLS to infer that housing may a major source of the rise in the share of profits in GDP. I got an e-mail from Simcha regarding the post, and the upshot is that I’m wrong. First, and foremost, it turns out that I got confused reading his paper, and all his calculations <em>exclude</em> residential housing. This means that my inference from comparing the BLS profit share to his profit share is invalid. You cannot conclude that residential housing profits are driving a rise in profits share of aggregate GDP, because there is no information on housing in Barkai’s number. He documents that the profit share of the non-financial corporate sector is rising over time.</p>
