I"A<p>As I wait to hear if and when UH will close campus because of the coronavirus I figured it would be a more productive use of my time to type than to update websites reporting case numbers. This post has absolutely nothing to do with the virus, so if you’re looking for something to either take your mind of of it, or at least put you to sleep, then here you go. At some point I’d like to do something about the economic impact of the virus, specifically using it to think about I/O networks and such, but I haven’t figured out a good way to work through that yet.</p>
