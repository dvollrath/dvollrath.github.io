I"Ú<p>In some recent Twittering, <a href="https://twitter.com/elidourado">Eli Dourado</a> pointed to the ‚ÄúGordon/Vollrath‚Äù view that stagnation is normal, healthy, and a sign of success. I guess it is kind of cool that I have a notable view, and being associated in some way with Bob Gordon is a nice honor for me (not sure how he feels about it). I made a few attempts to clarify what I thought about that view, but in the end I didn‚Äôt think I could pin it down on Twitter, so here we are.</p>
