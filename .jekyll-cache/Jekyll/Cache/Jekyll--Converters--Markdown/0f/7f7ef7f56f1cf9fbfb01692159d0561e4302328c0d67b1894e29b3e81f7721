I"ö<p>Nick Rowe just had a <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2016/02/does-saving-count-towards-gdp.html#more">post</a> about the effect of savings on GDP. Iâ€™m paraphrasing, but a student asks him whether â€œsaving an extra $100â€ raises GDP (or not), because the national income product accounts can be written as $Y = C + S + T$. I think Nick nails the issue, which is that you <em>must</em> specify â€œinstead of what?â€ when you say you â€œsave an extra $100â€.</p>
