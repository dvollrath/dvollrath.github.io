I"ô<p>Thanks to the Cavs/Spurs game turning into a snorer, I distracted myself by fixing up a few things on the new site. Rocking Saturday night, I know. Iâ€™m old.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SSL</strong>: The site is now using SSL, which means youâ€™ll see â€œhttpsâ€ in the web address. You donâ€™t need to do anything, the site automatically redirects you to the https link. If you want to save yourself a millisecond, change your link to the site to say â€œhttpsâ€ explicitly.</li>
  <li><strong>RSS Equations</strong>: One thing that came up in the transition was that the RSS feed was not rendering equations. Youâ€™d see markup code in your RSS reader, not a nicely formatted equation. This is fixedâ€¦.I think. In fact, hereâ€™s a little test. If you can see $y = x^2$ in your RSS feed as a nicely formatted equation, then apparently things are working well. If not, then I know what Iâ€™m doing next Saturday night.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, thanks for reading, and thanks for the patience with the tweaks.</p>
