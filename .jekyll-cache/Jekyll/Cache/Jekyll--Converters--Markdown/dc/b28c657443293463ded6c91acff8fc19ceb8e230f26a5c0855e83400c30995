I"¡<p>Brad Delong recently published his long-gestating economic history of the long 20th century, <a href="https://amzn.to/3SSuTWv">Slouching Towards Utopia</a>. If you are reading this blog, you are almost certainly aware of that, and I would guess the probability that youâ€™ve read it (or are reading it) are around 50/50. It has garnered well-deserved high praise from a variety of people. To avoid just repeating what everyone else is saying, let me simply say that it is a necessary book to read if you are at all interested in the subject of economic growth. It is informative and thought-provoking. If you are one of those 50% who have not read it, go do so now.</p>
