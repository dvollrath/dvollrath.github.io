I"Q<p>Before jumping into the proper post, some housekeeping. Thanks to a combination of Twitter’s situation and not missing Twitter while I took a hiatus this year, I really have no stake in staying over there. My account is still up, and for the time being I’ll keep the automated service that tweets out a link to my blog posts.</p>
