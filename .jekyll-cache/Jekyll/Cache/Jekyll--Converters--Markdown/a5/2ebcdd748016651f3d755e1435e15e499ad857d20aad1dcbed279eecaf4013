I"ş<p>In between checking weather updates here in Houston, I finally got around to reading the new working paper by Jan De Loecker and Jan Eeckhout (DE), on â€œ<a href="http://www.janeeckhout.com/wp-content/uploads/RMP.pdf">The Rise of Market Power and the Macroeconomic Implications</a>â€. The authors find that the markup of price over marginal cost charged by public US firms has been rising steadily since 1960, and in particular after 1980. It has generated a lot of commentary already, as in this <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com">post</a> by Noah Smith, this <a href="https://niskanencenter.org/blog/markups-market-power/">post</a> by Karl Smith, and <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/08/rise-market-power.html">this</a> from Tyler Cowen. A lot of the discussion so far has been about how to interpret their results, and whether it indicates a rise in â€œmarket powerâ€, and that devolved somewhat into a discussion of how to define â€œmarket powerâ€ in the first place.</p>
