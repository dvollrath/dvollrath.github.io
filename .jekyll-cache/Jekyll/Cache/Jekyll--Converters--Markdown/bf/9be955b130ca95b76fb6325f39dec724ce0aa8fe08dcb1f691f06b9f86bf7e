I"°<p>That‚Äôs the title of Greg Clark‚Äôs <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/jechis/v47y1987i01p141-173_04.html">article</a> from 1987 on cotton production in the early 20th century. Clark uses that specific industry to study the sources of variation across countries in real wages. I revisited it recently because I want to use it in my graduate course, and because I think it lays out a clear case for what could be loosely called a ‚Äúcultural‚Äù explanation for differences in development. In short, the paper is going to come to the conclusion that poor countries are poor because of some unknown cultural source that supports a norm of low efficiency of labor.</p>
