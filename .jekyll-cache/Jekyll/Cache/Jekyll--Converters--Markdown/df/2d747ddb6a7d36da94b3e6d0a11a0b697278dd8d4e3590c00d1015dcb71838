I"ù<p>There is accumulating evidence that the market power of firms - as proxied by their profits or the markup they charge over marginal cost - has risen over the last 15 or 30 years. While some market power may be necessary to create incentives for innovation, it is possible that there is â€œtoo muchâ€ market power and that this is limiting growth. At the same time, market power affects how we <em>measure</em> economic growth, and so the effect of rising market power isnâ€™t immediately obvious.</p>
