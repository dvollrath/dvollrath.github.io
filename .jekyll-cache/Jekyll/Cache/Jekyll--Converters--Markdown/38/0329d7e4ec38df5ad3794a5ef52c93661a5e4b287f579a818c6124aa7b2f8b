I"÷<p>One of the long-running arguments in growth is â€œgeography versus institutionsâ€. A lot of ink and a tiny amount of computing power was thrown at this question. The early stages of this involved a lot of cross-country regressions that attempted to figure out empirically whether measures of institutions or geography had explanatory power for GDP per capita. (By the way, Iâ€™m talking here just about the economic growth literatureâ€™s take on this. The general question goes back centuries.)</p>
