I"<p>I told you I wouldnâ€™t leave you waiting on the next post concerning markups and the paper by <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/JCsTqiauR0JBboj3vsNFRhyw9MrxV3B0j7L3f4fURJnfAUAxSXJXASiRl8OFiU2F/file">David Baqaee and Emmanuel Fahri</a>, so here you go. In the <a href="https://growthecon.com/blog/Paradox/">last post</a>, I described the (at times) paradoxical nature of markups. When there is <em>dispersion</em> in markups, output is lower than it could otherwise be, given technology. But when there is dispersion in markups, there are circumstances - like increasing markups in low-markup producers or shifting resources towards high-markup producers - where raising the average markup in the economy will be associated with higher output.</p>
