I"ì<p>Last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias">Matt Yglesias</a> dug up an old <a href="https://growthecon.com/blog/labors-share-profits-and-the-productivity-slowdown/">post</a> of mine about laborâ€™s share of output and the measurement of productivity. The short version was that the decline in laborâ€™s share may be part of the explanation for why measured productivity growth has slowed down in the same period of time. The original post was a bit math-heavy, and several people on Twitter were looking for a more intuitive explanation of what was going on. I was at the beach (sorry, <em>down the shore</em>) last week, so this response is coming in a little late, but hereâ€™s my attempt at explaining how this works. No math.</p>
