I"Ë<p>I told you in the last post that Iâ€™m agnostic about the relationship of TFP and innovation. That was part of an on-going debate, mainly with <a href="https://twitter.com/elidourado">Eli Dourado</a>. I want to pause at the outset to say that this debate is <em>great</em>. Itâ€™s been respectful, interesting, and forced me to think hard about some things. So welcome to the 0.0001% of the internet that does not make you want to gouge your eyes out.</p>
