I"Ô<p>A whole raft of posts and articles (<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2612047">here</a>, <a href="https://promarket.org/are-we-all-rent-seeking-investors/">here</a>, <a href="http://equitablegrowth.org/what-are-the-factors-behind-high-economic-rents/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/12/17/robert-reich-challenging-oligarchy/#fnr-5">here</a>) has shown up recently regarding ‚Äúrent-seeking‚Äù.
