I"<p>Back in March, I <a href="https://growthecon.com/blog/When-Growth/">posted</a> a summary of some <a href="https://jacobweisdorf.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/unreal-wages_humphries-and-weisdorf_dec-2017_wp1.pdf">research</a> by Jane Humphries and Jacob Weisdorf on the onset of economic growth. Their paper documented <em>annual</em> labor contract terms in England over several centuries, and compared those to the typical <em>day</em> labor rates that have been used in economic history to study the onset of growth and the effects of the Industrial Revolution. The short version of that paper is that the annual labor contracts starting seeing sustained growth in their value around 1650 or so, far sooner than the day wages indicated. This pushes back the origin of economic growth to well before the actual technological IR, and this also matches the data on GDP per capita developed by Broadberry, Campbell, Klein, Overton, and van Leeuwen in <a href="https://amzn.to/2GnD1Nm">British Economic Growth, 1270-1870</a>.</p>
