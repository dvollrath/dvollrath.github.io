I"ÿ<p>Mike Konczal has a nice <a href="https://medium.com/@rortybomb/learning-from-trump-in-retrospect-dce431b23ed0#.70zws6ugy">article</a> about how important it is to distinguish â€œjobsâ€ from â€œthe economyâ€, and how Trump used that to his advantage. Noah Smith had a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-02/a-job-is-more-than-a-paycheck">summary</a> of the idea that a job is â€œmore than a paycheckâ€. In my head, this is a complement to the arguments that Dani Rodrik has been making for years, as in his 1997 book <a href="http://amzn.to/2gzJqH4">Has Globalization Gone too Far?</a>. In economist terms, the easiest way to say this is that having a job actually enters the utility function separately from the real wage it generates.</p>
