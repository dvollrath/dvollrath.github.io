I"½<p>It has been a looooong time since I posted anything, and I can assign blame to all sorts of things for this. Rather than get into those, I thought Iâ€™d come back to blogging by returning to the Kaldor facts. These are all observations about the stability of various macroeconomic aggregates that Kaldor used to motivate his own work on growth, and which were subsequently adopted by essentially everyone else who studied growth as well.</p>
