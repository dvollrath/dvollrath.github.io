I"ú<p>A good amount of discussion takes place about how to accelerate growth, with a lot of prominent examples coming from the US presidential primaries. Jeb! promised to get the growth rate of GDP to 4%. <a href="http://www.dollarsandsense.org/What-would-Sanders-do-013016.pdf">Gerald Friedman</a> said that Sandersâ€™ plans would raise growth to 5.3%, and the <a href="http://ineteconomics.org/uploads/general/romer-and-romer-evaluation-of-friedman1.pdf">Romerâ€™s</a> have published a rebuttal saying that is almost impossible to achieve. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/kocherlakota009/home/policy/thoughts-on-policy/2-23-16">Narayana Kocherlakota</a>, on the other hand, says that we can adopt policies that can achieve 5-6% growth over the next four years. I know Iâ€™ve <a href="https://growthecon.com/blog/insert-policy-here-wont-boost-growth-rates/">said before</a> that whatever your favorite policy is, it wonâ€™t boost growth rates by maybe more than 1 percentage point, so maybe you could hit 3%.</p>
