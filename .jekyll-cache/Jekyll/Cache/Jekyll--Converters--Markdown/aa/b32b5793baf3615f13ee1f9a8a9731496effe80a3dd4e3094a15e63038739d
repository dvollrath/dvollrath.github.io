I"Ë<p>Iâ€™ve got a new working paper out (<a href="/assets/2017-06-28-Constraint.pdf">pdf</a> or <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/hou/wpaper/2017-192-55.html">repec</a>), co-authored with Ryan Johnson, on Malthusian constraints. There is some material that weâ€™re cutting from the paper, because it is already getting too long, but I kind of like the graphs and the results, so I figured I would write them up here. Fair warning: there will be some math.</p>
