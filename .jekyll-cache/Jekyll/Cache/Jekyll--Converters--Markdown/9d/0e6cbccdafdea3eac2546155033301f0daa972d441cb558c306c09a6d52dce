I"{<p>Well, after a massive break from most social media and this blog, I am stretching my neck back out of the shell. This first post back is very much a “teaching post”, in that it’s a rough draft of how I might talk about this topic in a class. I have some ideas for more topical posts to come, but for the moment this is helping to limber up the old blogging muscles.</p>
