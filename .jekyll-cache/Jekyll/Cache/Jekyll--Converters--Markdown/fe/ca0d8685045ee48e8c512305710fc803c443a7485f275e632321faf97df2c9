I"¨<p>In my last <a href="https://growthecon.com/blog/Manufacturing/">post</a>, I got upset because people were using measures of productivity as measures of firm or industry financial performance. And as part of that, I made the point that GDP (which is part of measuring productivity) has nothing to do with profits, or financial success in any way. A few people asked me about this, because it wasnâ€™t obvious to them.</p>
