I"5<p>A very quick post just to alert you that I’ve added a new page of <a href="https://growthecon.com/references/">references</a> to the site. It is essentially a dump of my own BibTeX file, broken down by topic area.</p>

<p>It’s incomplete, but as I clean up and add to the references over time, they’ll populate to that page. Of course, I’ll probably be in my 70’s before I get around to it, but maybe announcing it publicly will act as a commitment device. It can’t make me go any <em>slower</em> at fixing up my BibTeX file, that’s for sure.</p>
