I"˜<p>The fact that economic growth has slowed in the last few decades is not news, at least not on this blog. And Iâ€™ve been through a series of possible explanations over the course of the last few years. One bit of data that I played around with a few years ago was the decline in the growth rate of capital per worker. In this <a href="https://growthecon.com/blog/describing-the-decline-of-capital-per-worker/">post</a> I looked at some figures using BLS data that showed the amount of capital per worker was <em>declining</em> in 2010-2013. That was unprecedented, as even during recessions in the past it was the case that capital per worker kept growing.</p>
