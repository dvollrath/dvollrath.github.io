I"ë<p>One of the papers I use to introduce several ideas into my graduate growth and development course is by <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aejmac/v2y2010i3p65-97.html">Diego Comin, Bill Easterly, and Erick Gong</a>, titled â€œWas the Wealth of Nations Determined in 1000BC?â€. If we were being strict about things, the answer is no. But the longer answer is â€œWell, not really 1000BC. But there is a surprising amount of explanatory power in technology measures from 1500ADâ€.</p>
