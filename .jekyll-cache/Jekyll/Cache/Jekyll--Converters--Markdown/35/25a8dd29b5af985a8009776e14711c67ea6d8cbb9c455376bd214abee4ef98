I"º<p>Iâ€™m washing my hands, avoiding crowds (even more than normal), and thinking about the economic effects of the coronavirus. There is no question there has already been a significant effect, and there will be more effects to come. Iâ€™m thinking about what those effects are, how they are distributed across industries (e.g. airlines versus trucking), and how the affected industries influence <em>other</em> industries and consumers.</p>
