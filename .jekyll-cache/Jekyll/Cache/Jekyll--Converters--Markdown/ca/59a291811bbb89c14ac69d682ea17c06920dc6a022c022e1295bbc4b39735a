I"s<p>A quick follow-up to last December’s original <a href="https://growthecon.com/blog/roman-history-reading/">Roman History Reading List</a>, which turned out to be pretty popular. As before, this is “hobby reading” for me, and I make no claims about these lists being definitive. But if you are interested in dipping into this area, the lists will be helpful.</p>
