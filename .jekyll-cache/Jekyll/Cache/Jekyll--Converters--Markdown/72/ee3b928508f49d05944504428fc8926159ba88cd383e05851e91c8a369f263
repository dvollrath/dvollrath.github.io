I"Ã<p>This is both a welcome message to my new site - <a href="http://growthecon.com">growthecon.com</a> - as well as a test that everything is working out alright.</p>

<p>The Growth Economics Blog is now located here, but the old <a href="https://growthecon.wordpress.com">Wordpress site</a> will linger on for a while. I know people have links set up to old posts that they may use in classes. Iâ€™ll provide some warning of when those links will die. And they may never die, because I will probably forget to ever close down the old Wordpress site.</p>

<p>For now, if you are still along for the ride, I appreciate it. In terms of following the new site:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Email</strong>. Iâ€™ve set up a new mailing service for all the existing subscribers. You should have to do nothing. If you would like to subscribe via email, there is a link at the bottom of the home page to do that.</li>
  <li><strong>RSS</strong>. Click <a href="http://growthecon.com/feed.xml">here</a> for the new feed, or copy and paste the link into your favorite reader.</li>
  <li><strong>Twitter</strong>. New posts will continue to get pushed to Twitter, so follow me at <a href="https://twitter.com/DietzVollrath">@DietzVollrath</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Comments are enabled here, and the old comments have all been imported. You may have to create a new login for the new commenting service. I apologize for that, but I didnâ€™t have any way around it.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
