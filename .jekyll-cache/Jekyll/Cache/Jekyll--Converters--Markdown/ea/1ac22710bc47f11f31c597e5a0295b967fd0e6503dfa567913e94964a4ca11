I"÷<p>Since I am an intellectual raccoon, it was not a surprise that when <a href="https://twitter.com/GarettJones">Garett Jones</a> dangled a shiny object called ‚Äúthe inverse farm-size productivity relationship‚Äù in front of me on Twitter, I grabbed hold with my dirty little paws and would not let go. The inverse farm-size productivity (IFSP) relationship is something I‚Äôve been interested in since grad school, and my very first published paper has a strong link to the subject. But from Garett‚Äôs tweet, and the responses it gathered, I realized I was a bit behind on the state of this literature. And so here we are, with a blog post that is something of a literature review and something of a critical analysis.</p>
