I"Ö<p>I finished reading Robert Gordonâ€™s <a href="http://amzn.to/1Sb860J">The Rise and Fall of American Growth</a> a while ago, but finally found the time to write down an extended review. Iâ€™m way behind the curve. <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2016-02-15/innovation-over">Tyler Cowen</a> has an excellent review, and <a href="https://twitter.com/UpdatedPriors">Ryan Decker</a> sort of live-tweeted his way through the book recently.</p>
