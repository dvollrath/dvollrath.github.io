I"þ<p>I just <a href="https://growthecon.com/blog/Gordon-Review/">reviewed</a> Bob Gordonâ€™s book on the rise and fall of American growth. A quick recap of Gordonâ€™s thesis is that we experienced an anomalous burst of technological progress during the 1930â€™s and 1940â€™s, bleeding a little into the 1950â€™s and 60â€™s. Prior to that period, and since that period, technological progress was relatively slow, and Gordon expects that slow technological progress to be the norm for the foreseeable future.</p>
