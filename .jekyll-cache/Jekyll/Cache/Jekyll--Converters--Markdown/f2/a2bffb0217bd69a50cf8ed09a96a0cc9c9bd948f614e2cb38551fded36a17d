I"<p>A few weeks ago I participated in a discourse on <a href="https://www.pairagraph.com/dialogue/ee04c261817f45f39e1d0bb5f63e0b90">Pairagraph</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/elidourado">Eli Dourado</a> of the Center for Growth and Opportunity. The prompt was “Economic growth is stagnating, but there’s more to the story.” I argued that one should not interpret stagnation as implying something is wrong with the economy, and Eli argued that there was evidence of a real slowdown not just in technological growth, but in growth of welfare/well-being. You will be shocked to learn that I think my take on this subject is more accurate. But you should check out both sides of this because Eli’s position is a credible one and he does a good job of arguing it.</p>
