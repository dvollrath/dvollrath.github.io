I"¨<p>This post is about savings. It is also a plea with Nick Rowe to slow the <em>)#</em>#@ down in posting things that get stuck in my head. Iâ€™m still working on this savings thing, and now heâ€™s got a <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2014/05/mrscc1r1mpkmrtcidmrtcidt.html">post</a> up about capital that Iâ€™m chewing over too. I have a life, Nick, for Godâ€™s sake - pump the brakes!</p>
