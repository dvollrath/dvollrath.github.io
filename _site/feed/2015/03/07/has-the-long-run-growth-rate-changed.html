        <p>My actual job bothered to intrude on my life over the last week, so I've got a bit of material stored up for the blog. Today, I'm going to hit on a definitional issue that creates lots of problems in talking about growth. I see it all the time in my undergraduate course, and it is my fault for not being clearer.</p>
<p>
If I ask you "Has the long-run growth rate of the U.S. declined?", the answer depends crucially on what I mean by "long-run growth rate". I think of there as being two distinct definitions. </p>
<ul>
<li> <b>The measured growth rate of GDP over a long period of time:</b> The measured long-run growth rate of GDP from 1985 to 2015 is ${(\ln{Y}_{2015} - \ln{Y}_{1985})/30}$. Note that here the measurement does not have to take place using only past data. We could calculate the expected measured growth rate of GDP from 2015 to 2035 as ${(\ln{Y}_{2035} - \ln{Y}_{2015})/20}$. Measured growth rate depends on the actual path (or expected actual path) of GDP. 	</li>
<li> <b>The underlying trend growth of potential GDP:</b> This is the sum of the trend growth rate of potential output per worker (we typically call this ${g}$) and the trend growth rate of the number of workers (which we'll call ${n}$).
</li>
</ul>
<p>The two ways of thinking about long-run growth inform each other. If I want to calculate the measured growth rate of GDP from 2015 to 2035, then I need some way to guess what GDP in 2035 will be, and this probably depends on my estimate of the underlying trend growth rate. </p>
<p>
On the other hand, while there are theoretical avenues to deciding on the underlying trend growth rate (through ${g}$, ${n}$, or both), we often look back at the measured growth rate over long periods of time to help us figure trend growth (particularly for ${g}$). </p>
<p>
Despite that, telling me that one of the definitions of the long-run growth rate has fallen does not necessarily inform me about the other. Let's take the work of <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/19895.html">Robert Gordon</a> as an example. It is about the underlying trend growth rate. Gordon argues that ${n}$ is going to fall in the next few decades as the US economy ages and hence the growth in number of workers will slow. He also argues that ${g}$ will fall due to us running out of useful things to innovate on. (<i>I find the argument regarding ${n}$ strong and the argument regarding ${g}$ completely unpersuasive. But read the paper, your mileage may vary.</i>)</p>
<p>
Now, is Gordon right? Data on the measured long-run growth rate of GDP does <i>not</i> tell me. It is entirely possible that relatively slow measured growth from around 2000 to 2015 reflects some kind of extended cyclical downturn but that ${g}$ and ${n}$ remain just where they were in the 1990s. I've talked about this <a href="https://growthecon.wordpress.com/2014/05/20/is-robert-gordon-right-about-u-s-growth/" title="Is Robert Gordon Right about U.S. Growth?">before</a>, but statistically speaking it will be decades before we can even hope to <i>fail to reject</i> Gordon's hypothesis using measured long-run growth rates. </p>
<p>
This brings me back to some current research that I posted about <a href="https://growthecon.wordpress.com/2015/02/18/significant-changes-in-gdp-growth/" title="Significant Changes in GDP Growth">recently</a>. Juan Antolin-Diaz, Thomas Drechsel, and Ivan Petrella have a <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/tracking-gdp-when-long-run-growth-uncertain">recent paper</a> that finds "a significant decline in long-run output growth in the United States". [<i>My interpretation of their results was not quite right in that post. The authors e-mailed with me and cleared things up. Let's see if I can get things straight here.</i>] Their paper is about the measured growth rate of long-run GDP. They don't do anything as crude as I suggested above, but after controlling for the common factors in other economic data series with GDP (etc.. etc..) they find that the long-run measured growth rate of GDP has declined over time from 2000 to 2014. Around 2011 they find that the long-run measured growth rate is so low that they can reject that this is just a statistical anomaly driven by business cycle effects. </p>
<p>
What does this mean? It means that growth has been particularly low so far in the 21st century. So, yes, the "long-run measured growth rate of GDP has declined" in the U.S., according to the available evidence.</p>
<p>
The fact that Antolin-Diaz, Drechsel, and Petrella find a lower measured growth rate similar to the CBO's projected growth rate of GDP over the next decade does not tell us that ${g}$ or ${n}$ (or both) are lower. It tells us that it is possible to reverse engineer the CBO's <i>assumptions</i> about ${g}$ and ${n}$ using existing data.</p>
<p>
But this does not necessarily mean that the underlying trend growth rate of GDP has actually changed. If you want to establish that ${g}$ or ${n}$ changed, then there is no retrospective GDP data that can prove your point. Fundamentally, predictions about ${g}$ and ${n}$ are guesses. Perhaps educated guesses, but guesses.</p></p></p></p></p>
