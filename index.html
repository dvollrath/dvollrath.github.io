Use the navigation bar at the top of the page to find information on my research, my undergraduate textbook with Chad Jones, my book <i>Fully Grown</i>, or the Growth Economics Blog. If you are a student looking for class information, everything you need is on Blackboard. 

I recently moved the blog itself over to Substack. You can subscribe using this:

or visit [the site](https://dietrichvollrath.substack.com) directly. Thanks.
